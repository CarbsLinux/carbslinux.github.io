It has been a busy week. There are lots of changes in
direction, and more to come. I want to talk a little
about all of them.


Carbs Linux Server Going Down
-----------------------------

It became harder to maintain and pay for the server, and I will be
shutting it down in May. I am currently in the phase of
carrying over everything to [Github]. The repository and the
website is served on Github now. I have also moved the [Wiki]
to Github and anyone can edit it there. There are some outdated
posts that I will be fixing around this week.

I am not quite sure where to store the downloads page now. But I
will be switching that to a new source as well. (Maybe Source Forge?)

I feel a little sad for switching, but serving on Github is faster,
cheaper, and hassle-free.

Forking KISS
------------

I had a personal fork of KISS, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I didn't
intend to make it the default when I started it, but it has matured
enough to be so. The package manager can now be found on [this repository].
See it for the added changes.

This will be a change for the better, as I can develop the package
manager as it fits my views.

Small Changes on the Website
----------------------------

I have made some small changes on the website. The build is not dependent
on Plan9 utilities anymore. It was fun messing around with `rc` and `mk`,
but they are quite limited compared to POSIX shell. 

RSS feeds are finally working as intended, both for the [news] section, and
the [blog] secion.

You can see every page's `.txt` output at the end of the page by clicking
'View Page Source'. Meanwhile, I will be updating some pages to be a little
more 'human-readable'.

Outsources Repository
---------------------

I have opened an `outsource` repository, which I will be pushing this week.
I will add a new post when I am ready to push it. I think it will be interesting,
it will also make more sense about the changes I have added to the package
manager. The now empty repository, can be found [here]!

New Tarball
-----------

Finally, I have released a new tarball today, which can be obtained from the
[downloads page].

I am planning to add more of these update posts as I'm feeling better about
the website structure overall.
