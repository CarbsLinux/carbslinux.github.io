Carbs Linux kiss version 2.0.0 has been released which introduces rsync
repositories.
</p>

<p>
Git is no longer a mandatory dependency for the package manager, every git
source on the core repository has been replaced with https sources (sbase,
sinit), and rootfs tarballs will no longer ship with git. Repositories in the
upcoming tarball will be rsync repositories.
</p>

<p>
Git is now on the <code>extra</code> repository and is still (optionally) used in the
package manager.
</p>

<p>
The idea behind this change is size reductions and increased speed with rsync.
As I said on the previous post, git repositories get larger and larger over the
time span. Currently my personal copy of the git repository is around 77MB and I
have forked KISS Linux (as a shallow copy) around December. Obviously, I have
commits that I ommitted. I tend to create commits I dislike, which I change with
<code>git reset --soft HEAD^</code>, which doesn't actually remove the commits, etc. A user
will have a repository much smaller than mine.
</p>

<p>
This is a precaution with the added bonuses of speed and dropping a mandatory
dependency.
</p>

A few days ago, I have also published <a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux/kiss-bin">kiss-bin</a>, a first version for managing
binary repositories. Currently, there are some caveats that I'll be fixing along
the way. I decided not to include this in the package manager natively as
managing the source based and binary based packages together adds levels of
complexity that we do not want. Instead, this is an extension for kiss which
sources the package manager as a library. I hope to see it being adopted by
others interested on the matter as well.
