<h1>Outsource Repository Concept</h1>

<p>In April 3rd, I have added submodule support for Carbs
Linux&rsquo;s fork of <code>kiss</code>. Now, from that sentence, it really
doesn&rsquo;t sound exciting at all. But in reality, it opens a
path to lots of creative output, and a better way to manage
multi-user repositories (such as KISS Community).</p>

<p>When managing a repository of submodules, the repository
maintainer&rsquo;s only job is to deal with adding packages.
A package maintainer doesn&rsquo;t have to wait for the repository
maintainer to update their packages, as they are only making
the changes to their own repositories.</p>

<p>This way, an end-user can also track from their preferred
maintainers, and do that with the tidyness of a single repository
in their <code>KISS_PATH</code>.</p>

<p>Carbs Linux now has an outsource repository for some packages.
Firefox and its dependencies have been purged from the main repository,
but can be found on it.</p>
