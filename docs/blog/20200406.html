<h1 class="title">Roadmap for Carbs</h1>
<p class="subtitle">posted on 2020-04-06</p>
</header><p>
It has been a busy week. There are lots of changes in direction, and more to
come. I want to talk a little about all of them.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb0c7d87" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb0c7d87">Carbs Linux Server Going Down</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0c7d87">
<p>
It became harder to maintain and pay for the server, and I will be shutting it
down in May. I am currently in the phase of carrying over everything to <a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux">Github</a>.
The repository and the website is served on Github now. I have also moved the
<a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux/wiki/wiki">Wiki</a> to Github and anyone can edit it there. There are some outdated posts that
I will be fixing around this week.
</p>

<p>
I am not quite sure where to store the downloads page now. But I will be
switching that to a new source as well. (Maybe SourceHut?)
</p>

<p>
I feel a little sad for switching, but serving on Github is faster, cheaper, and
hassle-free.

<div id="outline-container-orgc2bcab5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc2bcab5">Forking KISS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc2bcab5">
<p>
I had a personal fork of KISS, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I didn't intend to
make it the default when I started it, but it has matured enough to be so. The
package manager can now be found on <a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux/kiss">this repository</a>. See it for the added
changes.
</p>

<p>
This will be a change for the better, as I can develop the package manager as it
fits my views.

<div id="outline-container-org0538658" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0538658">Small Changes on the Website</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0538658">
<p>
I have made some small changes on the website. The build is not dependent on
Plan9 utilities anymore. It was fun messing around with <code>rc</code> and <code>mk</code>, but they
are quite limited compared to POSIX shell.
</p>

<p>
RSS feeds are finally working as intended, both for the <a href="https://carbslinux.org/news.xml">news</a> section, and the
<a href="https://carbslinux.org/rss.xml">blog</a> section.
</p>

<p>
You can see every page's <code>.txt</code> output at the end of the page by clicking 'View
Page Source'. Meanwhile, I will be updating some pages to be a little more
'human-readable'.

<div id="outline-container-orge097249" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge097249">Outsources Repository</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge097249">
<p>
I have opened an <code>outsource</code> repository, which I will be pushing this week. I
will add a new post when I am ready to push it. I think it will be interesting,
it will also make more sense about the changes I have added to the package
manager. The now empty repository, can be found <a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux/outsource">here</a>!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org80536a3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org80536a3">New Tarball</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org80536a3">
<p>
Finally, I have released a new tarball today, which can be obtained from the
<a href="https://dl.carbslinux.org/releases">downloads page</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am planning to add more of these update posts as I'm feeling better about the
website structure overall.
