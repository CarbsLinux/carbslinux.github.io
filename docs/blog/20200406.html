<h1>Roadmap for Carbs</h1>

<p>It has been a busy week. There are lots of changes in
direction, and more to come. I want to talk a little
about all of them.</p>

<h2>Carbs Linux Server Going Down</h2>

<p>It became harder to maintain and pay for the server, and I will be
shutting it down in May. I am currently in the phase of
carrying over everything to <a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux">Github</a>. The repository and the
website is served on Github now. I have also moved the <a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux/wiki/wiki">Wiki</a>
to Github and anyone can edit it there. There are some outdated
posts that I will be fixing around this week.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure where to store the downloads page now. But I
will be switching that to a new source as well. (Maybe Source Forge?)</p>

<p>I feel a little sad for switching, but serving on Github is faster,
cheaper, and hassle-free.</p>

<h2>Forking KISS</h2>

<p>I had a personal fork of KISS, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I didn&rsquo;t
intend to make it the default when I started it, but it has matured
enough to be so. The package manager can now be found on <a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux/kiss">this repository</a>.
See it for the added changes.</p>

<p>This will be a change for the better, as I can develop the package
manager as it fits my views.</p>

<h2>Small Changes on the Website</h2>

<p>I have made some small changes on the website. The build is not dependent
on Plan9 utilities anymore. It was fun messing around with <code>rc</code> and <code>mk</code>,
but they are quite limited compared to POSIX shell.</p>

<p>RSS feeds are finally working as intended, both for the <a href="https://carbslinux.org/news.xml">news</a> section, and
the <a href="https://carbslinux.org/rss.xml">blog</a> secion.</p>

<p>You can see every page&rsquo;s <code>.txt</code> output at the end of the page by clicking
&lsquo;View Page Source&rsquo;. Meanwhile, I will be updating some pages to be a little
more &lsquo;human-readable&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Outsources Repository</h2>

<p>I have opened an <code>outsource</code> repository, which I will be pushing this week.
I will add a new post when I am ready to push it. I think it will be interesting,
it will also make more sense about the changes I have added to the package
manager. The now empty repository, can be found <a href="https://github.com/CarbsLinux/outsource">here</a>!</p>

<h2>New Tarball</h2>

<p>Finally, I have released a new tarball today, which can be obtained from the
<a href="https://dl.carbslinux.org/releases">downloads page</a>.</p>

<p>I am planning to add more of these update posts as I&rsquo;m feeling better about
the website structure overall.</p>
