First Year of Carbs Linux
================================================================================

December 10, 2020 marks the first year after the initial release of Carbs
Linux. When I forked the KISS Linux repository on the 9th of December, I was
fairly new to package management. Carbs Linux used to be almost identical to
KISS Linux. A lot has changed since then:

- Replaced default init system to `sinit`   [2020 Jan 13]
- Packaged `WebKit2GTK`                     [2020 Jan 15]
- Added `bearssl` on the testing repository [2020 May 17]
- Added `rsync` repository support to kiss  [2020 May 28]
- Replaced `bison` with `byacc`             [2020 Jun 03]
- Replaced `libressl` with `bearssl`        [2020 Jun 11]
- Replaced `kiss` with `cpt`                [2020 Jun 24]

I have really enjoyed maintaining and developing this distribution, and I want
to thank everyone who was involved in some way or another. While I have slowed
down in development due to college workload, I am still actively maintaining all
the packages on the repository. I do have some ideas that I am thinking of
implementing during the semester break. Hope to see you all in January.
