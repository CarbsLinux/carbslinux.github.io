<h1>August 2020 News Post</h1>

<p>We are having some stalls during this summer, as I am currently working on
university-related stuff. Nonetheless, there are some important changes that I
want to share in this month&rsquo;s post.</p>

<h2>INDEX</h2>

<h2>Carbs Packaging Tools</h2>

<p>This month I have reworked <code>kiss</code> into a new package manager, now renamed as
<code>cpt</code>. Updating <code>kiss</code> will now bootstrap the new package manager, so you don&rsquo;t
have to manually edit your system. If you don&rsquo;t like the idea of this, you can
look up the <code>post-install</code> script on <code>core/kiss</code> and apply the changes manually.</p>

<p>You will also need to rename your KISS<em>* variables to CPT</em>*. So, KISS_PATH
becomes CPT_PATH.</p>

<p>The rework changes the previous commands on the package manager into standalone
tools, and move the package manager functions to a library. This makes it easier
for a user to import functions and variables from the package manager, and
extend the package manager with their own intended way. Previously this required
ugly hacks and workarounds to use the package manager functions. I will be
making use of these changes to re-implement binary package management functions
as well.</p>

<p>If you want to use the library on your script you can simply do this:</p>

<pre><code>+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                          |
| #!/bin/sh                                                                |
| . cpt-lib                                                                |
| (...)                                                                    |
|                                                                          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>There are obviously some clean-up and simplifications needed in this new
tool-based package management method.</p>

<h2>Docs</h2>

<p>I have added documentation for the distribution, and finally updated the guide
for installation. It is now <em>almost</em> complete. These docs can be installed to
your system for online viewing. I will also add a documentation crawler similar
to how werc<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> works (but as an offline viewer). You can find <code>carbs-docs</code> from
the repository. Currently, the documentation lacks but I will be adding new
stuff. These will solely be distribution specific documentation and will not be
a wiki-like source. If anyone would like to contribute to a wiki-like
documentation source, I would happily re-open the distribution wiki. You can
find the source on https://github.com/CarbsLinux/docs</p>

<h2>Re-opening the Carbs Linux server</h2>

<p>Back in May, I had shutdown the Carbs Linux server due to financial issues, but
I am slowly reverting to the self-hosted model. Back then, the git repositories
were mirrored to GitHub, and the management was overall much more flexible. The
server used to run Carbs Linux as well (that was fun and horrifying at the same
time). Now, I will be relaunching the git server which will be the upstream
source before August 5. You can switch your remote, but GitHub will stay as a
remote nonetheless.</p>

<p>EDIT: The git-server is up!</p>
