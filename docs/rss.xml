<title>The Relation of Carbs and KISS</title>
<pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020</pubDate>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; May 08 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have forked KISS, I have received many questions
that can be summarized as &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;. I have realized that I
never truly answered this question. That&amp;rsquo;s the reason I am
writing this post, to give some background on Carbs, and
some differences between KISS Linux and Carbs Linux for
anyone who may be wondering. Perhaps I could make this a
&amp;ldquo;FAQ&amp;rdquo; page later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the idea of creating my own Linux distribution since
the May of 2019. Back then, I had my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxfromscratch.org&quot;&gt;Linux from Scratch&lt;/a&gt;
build, and I wanted to slim it down my own way and replace
the software (with musl,sbase,etc.). The name Carbs Linux
was in my mind since then. I wanted to write my own package
manager, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with anything I had built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had written some incomplete package managers (all named &lt;code&gt;fat&lt;/code&gt;)
and I quickly threw them into the trash can, where they
honestly belonged. I would want to share them with you for
laughs, but my hard-drive got wiped and I have a problem
of not doing an &amp;ldquo;initial commit&amp;rdquo; until a program I write
is in a usable state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have obtained the &amp;lsquo;carbslinux.org&amp;rsquo; domain name in September
2019, but then life got on the way, and I stopped for a long
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day on Reddit, I saw Dylan&amp;rsquo;s post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/unixporn&quot;&gt;r/unixporn&lt;/a&gt; about
KISS, and I really thought that it was interesting. Here is
my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/ducd34/sowm_kiss_d/f7lua7x&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; to Dylan on that post. I checked out the package
manager and the repository. The packaging system was extremely
clean and well-thought. I decided to give it a go and fork
KISS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Differences between KISS and Carbs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I still baffle when people ask me this question. My
intention was never to create a distribution with specific
differences between KISS. My intention was being my own
BDFL of a distribution I maintain. There are lots of
differences between the main repositories, but they are subtle
and not worth talking about. I personally never even installed
KISS Linux on my system. So Carbs, isn&amp;rsquo;t something like a
downstream fork of KISS, it is just a distribution that was
initially based on KISS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to contribute as much as I can to KISS Linux. I think
that it is a brilliant distribution, and it was a great starting
point for Carbs. I am really grateful to Dylan and all the
other contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m working on now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have a few projects that I&amp;rsquo;m working on for Carbs.
These are,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BSD port for Carbs. For a while, I have been working on BSD
compatibility on my fork of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carbslinux/kiss&quot;&gt;package manager&lt;/a&gt;. I have tested,
without any more issues, on OpenBSD and FreeBSD. The biggest
issues remaining are choosing a vendor for BSD, packaging the
BSD source, and providing a minimal base (like busybox for BSD).
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with BSD, it has a single source code
for all of the utilities (kernel, command line programs, etc.).
Contributions (even chipping in ideas) are very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding binary package distribution support natively to the package
manager. Biggest issue in small/old computers are compile times.
This feature is for the bigger packages such as webkit, clang,
llvm that take a considerable amount of time. Some computers
with low memories cannot even compile firefox/webkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding rsync repository support to the package manager. This
is not a current issue, but rather a futureproofing. As time
passes, distribution repositories grow larger. KISS and Carbs
are young distributions without this problem right now. But
in something like 5 years, this size will presumably increase
to hundreds of megabytes. At that point it will be pointless
to have the repository sources unless you specifically need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s up with all the init/service daemons?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever checked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carbslinux/repository&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;, you may have noticed
that there are lots of init/service related packages. I have had
my fair share of time with all of them, and it is an area that I
am really interested in. I have even written my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cemkeylan/shinit&quot;&gt;init daemon&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cemkeylan/sysmgr&quot;&gt;service supervisor&lt;/a&gt;. I maintain all those packages on KISS
Community Repository as well with the exception of busybox. Those
are, &lt;code&gt;busybox init/runit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;runit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sinit&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sysmgr&lt;/code&gt;. I would
definitely recommend checking out &lt;code&gt;shinit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sysmgr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why I don&amp;rsquo;t publicize Carbs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of reasons I don&amp;rsquo;t publicize Carbs a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KISS is the better alternative in terms of support and community.
I work on maintaining this distribution just as hard as Dylan,
but in the end, Carbs is based on his original hard work, and I
believe that he deserves the recognition more than I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I cannot answer questions like &amp;ldquo;What is the difference?&amp;rdquo;, I
prefer staying as the silent sibling project of KISS Linux. Plus,
there is no point in dividing the newly-emerging community in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not because I don&amp;rsquo;t have ideas for the future of Carbs, I
do. I just think that I will deserve the recognition once those
above lists are checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s about it, if you have questions you can send me a
mail, ping me on IRC (my handle is &lt;code&gt;merakor&lt;/code&gt;), and I will be happy
to answer. Maybe your question fits this post, and I can update it
to thoroughly give an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
Cem&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Outsource Repository Concept</title>

<description>&lt;h1&gt;Outsource Repository Concept&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 3rd, I have added submodule support for Carbs
Linux&amp;rsquo;s fork of &lt;code&gt;kiss&lt;/code&gt;. Now, from that sentence, it really
doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound exciting at all. But in reality, it opens a
path to lots of creative output, and a better way to manage
multi-user repositories (such as KISS Community).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When managing a repository of submodules, the repository
maintainer&amp;rsquo;s only job is to deal with adding packages.
A package maintainer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for the repository
maintainer to update their packages, as they are only making
the changes to their own repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, an end-user can also track from their preferred
maintainers, and do that with the tidyness of a single repository
in their &lt;code&gt;KISS_PATH&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbs Linux now has an outsource repository for some packages.
Firefox and its dependencies have been purged from the main repository,
but can be found on it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Roadmap for Carbs</title>
<pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2020</pubDate>

<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a busy week. There are lots of changes in
direction, and more to come. I want to talk a little
about all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Carbs Linux Server Going Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became harder to maintain and pay for the server, and I will be
shutting it down in May. I am currently in the phase of
carrying over everything to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CarbsLinux&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. The repository and the
website is served on Github now. I have also moved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CarbsLinux/wiki/wiki&quot;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;
to Github and anyone can edit it there. There are some outdated
posts that I will be fixing around this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not quite sure where to store the downloads page now. But I
will be switching that to a new source as well. (Maybe Source Forge?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel a little sad for switching, but serving on Github is faster,
cheaper, and hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Forking KISS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a personal fork of KISS, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
intend to make it the default when I started it, but it has matured
enough to be so. The package manager can now be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CarbsLinux/kiss&quot;&gt;this repository&lt;/a&gt;.
See it for the added changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a change for the better, as I can develop the package
manager as it fits my views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small Changes on the Website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made some small changes on the website. The build is not dependent
on Plan9 utilities anymore. It was fun messing around with &lt;code&gt;rc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mk&lt;/code&gt;,
but they are quite limited compared to POSIX shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSS feeds are finally working as intended, both for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://carbslinux.org/news.xml&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; section, and
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://carbslinux.org/rss.xml&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; secion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see every page&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; output at the end of the page by clicking
&amp;lsquo;View Page Source&amp;rsquo;. Meanwhile, I will be updating some pages to be a little
more &amp;lsquo;human-readable&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Outsources Repository&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have opened an &lt;code&gt;outsource&lt;/code&gt; repository, which I will be pushing this week.
I will add a new post when I am ready to push it. I think it will be interesting,
it will also make more sense about the changes I have added to the package
manager. The now empty repository, can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CarbsLinux/outsource&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Tarball&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have released a new tarball today, which can be obtained from the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.carbslinux.org/releases&quot;&gt;downloads page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning to add more of these update posts as I&amp;rsquo;m feeling better about
the website structure overall.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Switching to New Website</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Switching to New Website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; Jan 28 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it before, this website
was powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://werc.cat-v.org&quot;&gt;werc&lt;/a&gt;. And
even though I liked it really much, it was too
powerful for a small website like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have decided to reimplement this website with
my own static generation scripts. The source will
probably be on &lt;a href=&quot;https://carbslinux.org/git/website/log.html&quot;&gt;https://carbslinux.org/git/website/log.html&lt;/a&gt;
when I decide to publish the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generation requires Plan9 programs, although
I have used them just for my enthusiasm. I have built
the site with a combination of mk (instead of make), rc,
and POSIX sh. I am not yet exactly familiar with rc,
but I will replace the shell scripts when I feel like
I can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
