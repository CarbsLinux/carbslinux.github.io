Carbs Linux is a source-based Linux(r) distribution that aims to be
simple, flexible and extensible while staying as pragmatic and practical
as possible.  The system can consist of as much or as little as its user
can intend to.


Package Manager
===============

  Carbs Linux uses its own package manager [Carbs Packaging Tools], a
  POSIX shell package manager forked from KISS with the tool-based
  approach of xbps.

Small base
==========

  By default, Carbs Linux comes with busybox for coreutils, bearssl for
  its crypto library, musl libc, and other basic utilities that are
  required for building new software. The majority of the base packages
  are statically linked.


Multiple Init Support
=====================

  Carbs Linux has support for multiple init systems and service
  supervisors. In the main repository are

  - `sinit'
  - `busybox-init' (SysVinit clone)
  - `runit-init'

  for init systems, and

  - `sysmgr'
  - `busybox-runit'
  - `runit'

  for service supervisors. The [carbs-init] package is the collection of
  init scripts that ensure the interoperability of these init and
  service systems, and make it easier for the user to switch to their
  preferred combinations of system supervision.

  Nothing holds you back, however, from ditching any of these and
  packaging some other system supervision technique along with your own
  init scripts.
