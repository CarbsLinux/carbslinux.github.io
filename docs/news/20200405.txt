Carbs Linux repositories will be hosted only on Github. Commits will be
pushed there, and not the repository. You have until May 4, 2020 Monday
to switch your remotes to
<https://github.com/CarbsLinux/repository>. The git repository will
continue to be served until then (without additional commits).

You can switch your remote by executing the following command on your
repository directory.

,----
| git remote set-url origin https://github.com/CarbsLinux/repository
