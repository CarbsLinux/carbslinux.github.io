  Carbs Linux repositories will be hosted only on Github. Commits will
  be pushed there, and not the repository. You have until May 4, 2020
  Monday to switch your remotes to
  <https://github.com/CarbsLinux/repository>. The git repository will
  continue to be served until then (without additional commits).

  You can switch your remote by executing the following command on your
  repository directory.

  **IMPORTANT!** Carbs-init update to be released on 17th of February
  will require manual intervention. I am holding this update back so
  people can see it before they update their system (even though the
  update will show the same message as this). The rationale for the
  update is explained below the intervention.

  ,----
  | # There is an explanation for each init You only need to follow the instructions
  | # for your own init-system
  | 
  | ## busybox-init
  | # If you did not edit your inittab simply move inittab.new to inittab
  | mv /etc/inittab.new /etc/inittab
  | 
  | # If you did edit your inittab you can use a simple sed command to remove the
  | # necessary lines
  | sed -i '/getty/d;/runsvdir/d' /etc/inittab
  | 
  | 
  | ## runit
  | # same as busybox-init, if you did not edit /etc/runit/2 move 2.new to 2
  | mv /etc/runit/2.new /etc/runit/2
  | 
  | # else
  | vim /etc/runit/2
  | # open your 2 file and remove the for loop containing getty commands. If you are
  | # using runit, it is recommended to comment out /etc/init/runit.boot
  | 
  | ## sinit/minit
  | # If you did not edit your {sinit-,}launch-services.boot you can simply remove
  | # it.
  | rm -f /etc/init/launch-services.boot /etc/init/sinit-launch-services.boot
  | 
  | # This should leave you without any issues, and you can safely reboot.
  `----

  Carbs-init update is to make sure init systems do not clash, and do
  not have to use different files. This is a sensible update both for
  the user user and for the maintainer side.

  To give an example, before this update busybox-init was managing getty
  through `inittab', runit was managing through `/etc/runit/2', and
  minit/sinit were launching from `/etc/init/launch-services.boot'. This
  is a configuration nightmare for everyone, and since I am maintaining
  and constantly testing those init providers, a huge nightmare for me.
  This is a Quality of Life update.
