**Busybox update reqires manual intervention**

The new busybox package conflicts with the pre-update busybox-init. That's why
you should rebuild and install `busybox-init` before doing the update.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Do a kiss update first (but don't actually update it yet), or manually pull
# the git repository
kiss u  # Cancel this operation after it asks for you to confirm the update

# Install the busybox-init package
kiss b busybox-init && kiss i busybox-init

# Continue your update as you normally would.
kiss u

#+END_SRC

I have moved runit and logging utilities from the busybox-init package to the busybox
package, which is the cause of these conflicts.
