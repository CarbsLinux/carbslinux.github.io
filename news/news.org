Carbs Linux's fork of the =kiss= package manager has been renamed to =Carbs
  Packaging Tools= due to huge amount of changes. Your latest =kiss= update will
handle the bootstrapping. You will need to rename your =KISS-*= variables to
=CPT-*=.

A GCC 10.1.0 change causes a kernel panic for kernels built with GCC 10.1. This
issue can be resolved by applying this [[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/patch/?id=f670269a42bfdd2c83a1118cc3d1b475547eac22][patch]] to your kernel sources.

**EDIT:** The patch is no longer necessary.

Carbs Linux repositories will be hosted only on Github. Commits will be pushed
there, and not the repository. You have until May 4, 2020 Monday to switch your
remotes to [[https://github.com/CarbsLinux/repository]]. The git repository will
continue to be served until then (without additional commits).

You can switch your remote by executing the following command on your repository
directory.

#+begin_src sh
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/CarbsLinux/repository
#+end_src

A new tarball is released. It can be found on [[https://dl.carbslinux.org]].

**edit:** I have removed the tarball because of a bootstrapping issue. I will be
re-adding it later today.

**edit 2:** I have added a tarball (20200219) to reflect my recent changes on
Busybox.

**IMPORTANT!** Carbs-init update to be released on 17th of February
will require manual intervention. I am holding this update back so
people can see it before they update their system (even though the
update will show the same message as this). The rationale for the
update is explained below the intervention.

#+begin_src sh
  # There is an explanation for each init You only need to follow the instructions
  # for your own init-system

  ## busybox-init
  # If you did not edit your inittab simply move inittab.new to inittab
  mv /etc/inittab.new /etc/inittab

  # If you did edit your inittab you can use a simple sed command to remove the
  # necessary lines
  sed -i '/getty/d;/runsvdir/d' /etc/inittab


  ## runit
  # same as busybox-init, if you did not edit /etc/runit/2 move 2.new to 2
  mv /etc/runit/2.new /etc/runit/2

  # else
  vim /etc/runit/2
  # open your 2 file and remove the for loop containing getty commands. If you are
  # using runit, it is recommended to comment out /etc/init/runit.boot

  ## sinit/minit
  # If you did not edit your {sinit-,}launch-services.boot you can simply remove
  # it.
  rm -f /etc/init/launch-services.boot /etc/init/sinit-launch-services.boot

  # This should leave you without any issues, and you can safely reboot.
#+end_src

Carbs-init update is to make sure init systems do not clash, and do
not have to use different files. This is a sensible update both for
the user user and for the maintainer side. 

To give an example, before this update busybox-init was managing getty
through =inittab=, runit was managing through =/etc/runit/2=, and
minit/sinit were launching from =/etc/init/launch-services.boot=. This
is a configuration nightmare for everyone, and since I am maintaining
and constantly testing those init providers, a huge nightmare for me. 
This is a Quality of Life update.
