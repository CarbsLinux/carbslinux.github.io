Happy new year, everyone! I am back after some long silence. I was unable to commit for a
while, but I have pulled some new updates from the KISS repository, added some of my own.
This week I will be changing/adding some things.

Important things are,

- Carbs-init was updated to 0.3.
- I will be adding an implementation of suckless.org's [[https://core.suckless.org/sinit][sinit]] as =carbs-sinit=
- Carbs Repository was added to [[https://repology.org/repository/carbs][repology.org]]
- A new rootfs tarball will be coming up tomorrow.
