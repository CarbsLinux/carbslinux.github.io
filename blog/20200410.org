#+TITLE: Outsource Repository Concept

In April 3rd, I have added submodule support for Carbs Linux's fork of =kiss=.
Now, from that sentence, it really doesn't sound exciting at all. But in
reality, it opens a path to lots of creative output, and a better way to manage
multi-user repositories (such as KISS Community).

When managing a repository of submodules, the repository maintainer's only job
is to deal with adding packages. A package maintainer doesn't have to wait for
the repository maintainer to update their packages, as they are only making the
changes to their own repositories.

This way, an end-user can also track from their preferred maintainers, and do
that with the tidyness of a single repository in their =KISS_PATH=.

Carbs Linux now has an outsource repository for some packages. Firefox and its
dependencies have been purged from the main repository, but can be found on it.
