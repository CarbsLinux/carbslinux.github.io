Carbs Linux is an in-development LinuxÂ® distribution with a suckless mindset.
The system will consist of only the necessary programs to create a Linux
distribution.

Package Manager
---------------

Carbs Linux is built upon the world's best Linux distribution 
[KISS Linux](https://getkiss.org) and uses [kiss](https://github.com/kisslinux/kiss)
as its package manager, which has proven to be extremely flexible. I aim to move Carbs
to an even more suckless path.


Sane defaults
-------------

By default, Carbs Linux comes with busybox for coreutils, runit as the system 
supervisor, and sinit as the init, though nothing holds you from changing any
of them.
