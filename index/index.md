Carbs Linux is an in-development LinuxÂ® distribution with a suckless mindset.
The base system consists of only the necessary programs to create a Linux
distribution.

Package Manager
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carbs Linux uses its own package manager [Carbs Packaging Tools], a POSIX shell
package manager forked from KISS with the tool-based approach of xbps.


Small base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, Carbs Linux comes with busybox for coreutils, bearssl for its crypto
library, musl libc, and other basic utilities that are required for building
new software. The majority of the base packages are statically linked.


Multiple Init Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carbs Linux has support for multiple init systems and service supervisors. In
the main repository are

- `sinit`
- `busybox-init` (SysVinit clone)
- `runit-init`

for init systems, and

- `sysmgr`
- `busybox-runit`
- `runit`

for service supervisors. The [carbs-init] package is the collection of init
scripts that ensure the interoperability of these init and service systems, and
make it easier for the user to switch to their preferred combinations of system
supervision.

Nothing holds you back, however, from ditching any of these and packaging some
other system supervision technique along with your own init scripts.
